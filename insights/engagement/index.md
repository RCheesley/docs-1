# Understanding your Engagement Levels

Your Engagement Levels are more than just a good metric of how many people your community has at different stages of involvement, the shape they make will often show you potential problems you have in the community onboarding process. Ideally you want to provide a nice, smooth process for members to reach the level of engagement they want to be at, neither pushing them further nor blocking them from getting there.

Below are some of the shapes you might see in your Engagement Levels chart, and what they mean for your community.

## Visitor Heavy

Every community member starts out as a Visitor, the default threshold for this is having just one conversation, so this is always going to be your largest level. Even in a healthy community there will be a large number of people who never progress past this level, they come and ask one question and leave as soon as it's answered. But ideally you want to keep people around and move them on to being active Participants in your community. 

If your Engagement Levels chart looks like this, it means people aren't seeing value in sticking around in your community, and you need to think about what your community has to offer them beyond transactional support.

## Core Heavy

The opposite situation is when you have too many Core member. It may seem counter-intuitive that you could have too many Core members, since the goal is always to level people up in your community, right? But when you have too large a percentage of your community at this level it often indicates that you're not serving those members who aren't ready to be there yet. Your community should offer value at all levels, not just the top most level, otherwise you're going to struggle to grow it.

If your Engagement Levels chart looks like this, it means your community feels out of reach to anybody who isn't willing or able to become a Core member, and you need to look into ways to make it more welcoming to more casual participants and one-off contributors.
