## Most Active and Engaged

You will also be shown your top 10 Members based on a couple of criteria: Activity and Engagement. Activity is the number of comments a Member of your community has made, regardless of where or to who. These are your most talkative members. Engagement, on the other hand, is the number of other Members that somebody has had a conversation with, regardless of how many comments were exchanged. These are your most social members. These two measurements combined will give you a good idea of who in your community is doing the most to keep it lively and welcoming.
